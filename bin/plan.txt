Using jsoup, load the html document
Using jsoup, add all words from the poem to a string
delete punctuation from the string
place the poem into a hashmap
sort the words in the map into descending order
print the sorted map in order 20 times
end

I decided against a manual .txt file read in favor of the jsoup
solution because I think it's more useful in real world scenarios where
it can adapt to new URLs.

Going into this I knew I'd have to follow these steps:

Import the html doc
extract only the poem into a string or array
delete punctuation
seperate words into a list of some kind
count how many time each word appears
print out top 20 words and frequencies
